cwi_heading: Measure Authoring Tool Overview
cwi_lead_text: >-
  Using the tool, authors create Clinical Quality Language (CQL) expressions,
  which have the conceptual portion of the Quality Data Model (QDM) as their foundation.
cwi_body: >-
  The tool provides the capability to express complex measure logic and export measures in several
  formats, including a human-readable document that can be viewed in a web browser, an eCQM
  HQMF XML document which provides metadata, terminology, data elements and specific
  population definitions respective to the measure, a CQL file which contains the terminology and
  expression logic used by the measure, an ELM XML export that is a computer-readable XML
  version of the CQL file, and a Javascipt Object Notation (JSON) export which is a serialized format
  of the ELM file. The data expressed in the tool by the users serves as the input for the creation of
  the defined export files.
