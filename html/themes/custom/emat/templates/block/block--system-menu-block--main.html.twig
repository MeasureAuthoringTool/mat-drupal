 *   - provider: The module or other provider that provided this block plugin.
 *   - Block plugin specific settings will also be stored here.
 * - content: The content of this block.
 * - attributes: array of HTML attributes populated by modules, intended to
 *   be added to the main container tag of this template.
 *   - id: A valid HTML ID and guaranteed unique.
 * - title_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main title
 *   tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
